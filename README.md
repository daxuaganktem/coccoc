Runtime environment Python 3.9.5

Add the data csv.gz file to the source folder.

Run splitter.py to split the data first, after that run sorter.py

The output will be in sorted.csv.gz

The complexity of splitting is O(nlog(n)), and merge sorting is O(nlog(n)) 

*The radix-multi file is just another solution but failed to sort correctly
