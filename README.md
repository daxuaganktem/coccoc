coccoc challenge

Runtime environment Python 3.9.5

Required: matplotlib

Istallation:

python -m pip install -U pip

python -m pip install -U matplotlib

Add the data csv.gz file to the source folder.

Run splitter.py to split the data first, after that run sorter.py

The output will be in sorted.csv.gz

The complexity of splitting is O(nlog(n)), and merge sorting is O(nlog(n)) 

*The radix-multi file is just another solution but failed to sort correctly

Update: exercise 1 and 2 completed with plot

We can extract from the plots shown that there are just a few categories with high frequency and high count

The categories are not distributed evenly, and the most popular categories are also the categories with the most count
